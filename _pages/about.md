I am a Ph.D. student in finance at the Swedish House of Finance, Stockholm School of Economics. My research interests include empirical asset pricing, investment strategies, machine learning and textual analysis, the implications of AI in finance, and sustainable finance.

My research focuses on the insights gleaned from textual data, the impact of artificial intelligence on finance, and the integration of environmental sustainability in financial practices.
